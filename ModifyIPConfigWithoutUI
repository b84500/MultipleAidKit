Tutorial to modify the IP Config of a Linux computer with only the terminal


===========================================================================

Go on terminal and open with NANO the following file :
/etc/network/interfaces

After that, you will have to reboot the networking service : 
(sudo) /etc/init.d/networking restart

NB : If the reboot fail, check your IP Configuration in the interfaces file.
Think to check the name of the interface (eth0, wlp3s0, enp2s0, etc.)
